# Pizza Sales Data Analytics Project

## Problem Statement

The project aims to build an interactive dashboard that validates data through SQL queries and Power BI visualizations. It provides insights into pizza sales performance, helping to analyze trends, identify best and worst-selling pizzas, and evaluate overall business performance.


### Steps followed 

Step 1: SQL Implementation

Data Import: Imported raw pizza sales data into MS SQL Server.

Database Creation: Set up a database and imported the necessary data files.

SQL Queries: Wrote queries based on problem statements to extract key metrics such as total revenue, average order value, and sales trends.

Documentation: Saved queries and their results for validation and future reference.

Step 2: Power BI Implementation

Data Connection: Connected Power BI to the SQL Server database for real-time data access.

Data Cleaning: Used Power Query to clean and transform the raw data, ensuring data quality and consistency.

Data Processing: Created custom columns and measures using DAX functions to calculate key metrics.

Data Visualization: Built interactive charts and dashboards, including:

KPIs: Displayed total revenue, average order values, total pizzas sold, total orders, and average pizzas per order.

Trends: Visualized daily and monthly order trends using column and line charts.

Sales Analysis: Represented sales by pizza category and size using donut and funnel charts.

Best/Worst Sellers: Identified top and bottom five pizzas by revenue, quantity, and orders using bar charts.

Interactive Features

Filters: Added slicers for pizza category and date range to dynamically update the dashboard.

Navigation: Implemented buttons to navigate between different pages of the dashboard.

Key Functionalities

Incorporated advanced DAX functions for dynamic calculations.

Applied conditional formatting for enhanced visual appeal.

Used action filters for seamless interactivity across dashboard components.

Final Output

The final dashboard provides comprehensive insights into sales performance, highlighting trends, key metrics, and actionable data validated through SQL queries.
